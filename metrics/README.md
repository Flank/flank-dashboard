## Libraries

* [states_rebuilder](https://pub.dev/packages/states_rebuilder) - states_rebuilder is a flutter state management solution that allows for clear and sharp separation of concern between the user interface (UI) logic and the business logic. The separation is clear and sharp to the point that the business logic is written with pure, vanilla, plain old dart classes without extending any external library-specific classes and without annotation or code generation.
* [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Equatable is an abstract class that helps to implement equality without needing to explicitly override == and hashCode.
* [fcharts](https://pub.dev/packages/fcharts) - fcharts is a chart library for flutter. Create beautiful, animated, responsive charts using a simple and intuitive API.
* [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) - url_launcher is a flutter plugin for launching a URL on Android and iOS. Supports web, phone, SMS, and email schemes.
* [test](https://pub.dev/packages/test) - test is a full featured library for writing and running Dart tests.
* [lint](https://pub.dev/packages/lint) - lint is an opinionated, community-driven set of lint rules for Dart and Flutter projects. Like pedantic but stricter.
* [collection](https://pub.dev/packages/collection) - Collections and utilities functions and classes related to collections.
* [args](https://pub.dev/packages/args) - args is a library for defining parsers for parsing raw command-line arguments into a set of options and values using GNU and POSIX style options.
