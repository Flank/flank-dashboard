  # The `github_actions` key defines that the following source config stands for Github Actions integration.
  github_actions:

    # A unique identifier of the Github Actions workflow.
    # 
    # The tool uses this identifier to fetch builds. 
    # This can be either the workflow ID or a name of the file that defines this workflow 
    # (for example, `web_actions.yaml`). You can surely use the name of your file as it is 
    # handier and clearer. To obtain the ID of the desired workflow, consider using the 
    # GitHub Actions REST API and list your repository workflows: 
    # - https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/actions#list-repository-workflows.
    workflow_identifier: ...

    # A name of the project's repository.
    #
    # The tool uses this name to perform HTTP calls in the scope of the defined repository.
    # 
    # You can obtain the repository name from GitHub. 
    # Browse to your repository and copy the repository name from the top bar. 
    # The name is the second part of the string the top bar contains: 
    # - <repository-owner>/<repository-name>.
    # You can also use the link that leads to your repository. For example: 
    # - https://github.com/<repository-owner>/<repository-name>
    repository_name: ...

    # An owner of the project's repository.
    #
    # The tool uses this value to perform HTTP calls in the scope of the defined owner.
    # 
    # You can obtain the repository owner from GitHub. 
    # Browse to your repository and copy the repository owner from the top bar. 
    # This value is the first part of the string the top bar contains: 
    # - <repository-owner>/<repository-name>.
    # You can also use the link that leads to your repository. For example: 
    # - https://github.com/<repository-owner>/<repository-name>
    repository_owner: ...

    # A name of the job within the Github Actions workflow.
    #
    # The tool uses this name to fetch a job associated with the concrete project builds.
    # Thus, a single build is a single job result within a workflow run. Here, job is
    # specified using the `job_name` field and workflow is specified using the `workflow_identifier`.
    #
    # You can obtain the job name by looking for it in a file that defines your workflow.
    # In this file, the `jobs` section contains a list of jobs that run within this workflow.
    # Each job in that list contains a `name` field standing for a name of this job.
    # Use the name of the desired job as the value for the `job_name` configuration field.
    # To know more about the workflow file contents and syntax, consider the following links:
    # - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
    # - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idname
    job_name: ...

    # A name of an artifact that contains a `coverage-summary.json` with coverage data for the build.
    #
    # The tool uses this name to identify an artifact it should fetch and download to parse coverage data.
    # If artifact with the specified name is not found, the coverage is considered as `null`,
    # meaning that no coverage data is available.
    #
    # You can obtain the coverage artifact name by looking for it in a file that defines your workflow.
    # Open the workflow file and look for a step that uploads an artifact related to coverage.
    # This step should define an artifact name you are looking for.
    # For example, if you are using `actions/upload-artifact@v2` (https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact):
    # ```
    #   - name: Upload coverage artifact
    #     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    #     with:
    #       name: <COVERAGE_ARTIFACT_NAME>
    #       path: path/to/coverage-summary.json
    # ```
    # Please note, that the coverage artifact *must* contain the `coverage-summary.json` file.
