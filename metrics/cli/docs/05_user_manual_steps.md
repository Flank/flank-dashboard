# The userâ€™s manual steps

## Motivation
> What problem is this project solving?

The motivation for this document is to describe all user's manual steps to implement them easily using prompt in the Metrics CLI and to be able to automate them in the future.

## Goals
> Identify success metrics and measurable goals.

This document meets the following goal:
 - Provide an overview of all user's manual steps required during the Metrics deployment process using the Metrics CLI.

## Steps

### Sentry Configuration

Since the Metrics project using Sentry, we should provide a detailed instruction, which helps a user to configure Sentry during the Metrics deployment process using the Metrics CLI.

Here is a prompt instruction, which helps the user to configure the Sentry:

```text

Here is a prompt instruction, which helps the user to configure Firebase auth:

```text
Firebase auth configuration instruction:

To enable Firebase auth for the current deploying project, consider the following steps:
1. Follow the link and click a "Get started" button: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project_id/authentication

### Default region configuration

Since the deployment of the Metrics project requires a GCloud project's region, we should provide a detailed instruction, 
which helps the user to select the [region/zone](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones) during the Metrics deployment process using the Metrics CLI.

Here is a prompt instruction, which helps the user to select a GCloud project's region:

```text
