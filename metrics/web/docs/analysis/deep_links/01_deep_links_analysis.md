# Deep Links Approaches Analysis
> Feature description / User story.

As a User, I want to pass direct links to project and/or project groups, so that other users can navigate more easily.

# Analysis
> Describe general analysis approach.

During the analysis stage we are going to investigate the implementation approaches for deep linking in Metrics Web application and chose the most suitable one for us.

### Feasibility study
> A preliminary study of the feasibility of implementing this feature.

Since the Flutter [supports deep links](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking) we are able to implement the deep linking in the Metrics Web application.

### Requirements
> Define requirements and make sure that they are complete.

- Possibility to handle deep links;
- Possibility to generate deep links in response to UI events (filtering, dropdown selections, searching, etc.);
- Extensible and testable approach.

### Landscape
> Look for existing solutions in the area.

#### Deep linking approach
(query parameters vs path segments)

#### Deep linking in the Metrics Web application
(Using notifier vs straight using route parameters)

### Prototyping
> Create a simple prototype to confirm that implementing this feature is possible.

### System modeling
> Create an abstract model of the system/feature.
