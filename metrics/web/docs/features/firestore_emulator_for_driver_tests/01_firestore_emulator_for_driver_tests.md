# Firestore emulator for driver tests

> Feature description / User story.

At the moment, integration tests run inside the production environment (e.g. using production Firestore). This approach carries the risk of accidental data loss or alteration. Therefore, we should use the test environment to run the tests.

# Analysis

> Describe general analysis approach.

To implement this feature, we've investigated the possibility of using the [Firebase Local Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

The Firebase Local Emulator consists of individual service emulators built to accurately mimic the behavior of Firebase services. This means we can connect our app directly to these emulators to perform integration testing without touching production data.

One of the services of the emulator is a Firestore that allows creating a local instance of the Firestore and use it during testing.

### Feasibility study

> A preliminary study of the feasibility of implementing this feature.

The Firestore emulator allows us to run integration tests using the test environment, so that can ensure that the tests do not affect the production data.

With that, we may not care about creating a large number of entities, deleting them, or changing them through tests.

_**Note:**
We are not configuring the [Firebase Auth emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_auth) because it is not available in the version of the [firebase_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) package we are using. So, during tests, we authenticate via the production Firebase Auth service._

### Requirements

> Define requirements and make sure that they are complete.

1. A Firestore emulator, run using the imported test data.
2. The web application uses the Firestore instance configured to use the emulator while running integration tests.
### Prototyping

> Create a simple prototype to confirm that implementing this feature is possible.

To run the driver tests under the Firebase emulator we should follow the next steps:

1.  Run the Firebase emulator before running the app under tests.
2.  Configure the application under tests to use the Firebase emulator instance before running tests.
3.  Run the driver tests as usual.

Before we run the emulator, we need to check the configurations in the `firebase.json` file.

The emulator will take Security Rules configuration from the `firestore` configuration key,
so make sure it links to the right file location.

```json
    "firestore": {
        "rules": "firestore/rules/firestore.rules",
        ...
    }
```

The default emulator's port is 8080.
To customize that you can specify an additional key in the `firebase.json` file.

```json
    "emulators": {
        "firestore": {
            "port": "8080"
        },
        ...
    }
```

The emulator erases the data inside the Firestore each time it starts.

To prepare the test data, we can manually create necessary collections and documents through the emulator's UI and save it using the following command:

```bash
firebase emulators:export export_directory
```

The specified `export_directory` will be created if it does not already exist. If the specified directory exists, you will be prompted to confirm that the previous export data should be overwritten. For more information on using the command consider [the following link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#export_and_import_emulator_data).

Now we can run the emulator with the initial data by adding the following flag `--import=import_directory`, where the `import_directory` is the directory that holds the exported data.

So with that in place, we can run the emulator by using the following command:

```bash
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore --import=import_directory
```

Now the emulator is running and it is time to use it in the app's integration tests.

In the `setUpAll` method of the tests we need to configure the Firestore instance to use the emulator:

```dart
setupAll(() {
    Firestore.instance.settings(
        host: 'localhost:8080',
        sslEnabled: false,
        persistenceEnabled: false,
    );
});
```

The specified port in the `host` argument must be equal to the emulator's port.

# Design

### User Interface

> How users will interact with the feature (API, CLI, Graphical interface, etc.).

The feature is introduced by adding an additional parameter - `use-firestore-emulator`(default to `true`) with the to the integration tests running command.

It determines whether the integration tests should run with the `Firebase Emulator`.

The following code snippet shows an example of using the new parameter:

```bash
dart test_driver/main.dart --use-firestore-emulator
```

Or, if you accept the default value, you can omit it.

As described in the [Prototyping](#prototyping) section, we should run integration tests once the `Firebase Emulator` started.

### Database

> How relevant data will be persisted.

Integration tests interact with the application that uses data from the database. As we don't want to use the production environment, we should use the `Firebase local emulator`.

By default, the emulator starts with no data, so we should add test data used during testing. The best approach to do so is importing the test data to the Firestore emulator once running. But before exporting the test data, we should create it. The `emulators:export` command allows to export the data from the running Firestore emulator. 

So, to create test data for the Firestore emulator, we should follow the next steps: 

1. Run the Firestore emulator.
2. Create test data in the Firestore emulator using the Firestore emulator UI. 
3. Run the `firebase emulators:export ../web/test_driver/firestore_test_data` command to export test data to the `export_directory` from inside the `metrics/firebase` directory.

The process of the test data creation will be performed only once and, the test data will be added to the version control.

Once we have exported data from the Firestore emulator, we can run an emulator with the exported data using the following command each time before running the driver tests:

```bash
firebase emulators:start --import=../web/test_driver/firestore_test_data
```

_**Note:** The command must be run inside the firebase folder to apply available Firestore rules._

### Program

> Detailed solution description to class/method level.

#### Configure the test runner

As we want to use the Firebase emulator to run integration tests, we should add a parameter - `use-firestore-emulator`, that determines whether tests should use the production database or run the local emulator with test data.

To simplify the logic of retrieving the parameter's value inside the integration tests, we should create the `FirestoreEmulatorConfig` model.

To pass the Firestore emulator configuration to the application under tests, we are going to update the `FlutterWebDriver` class and add a new `dart-define` option containing the `Map` representation of the Firestore emulator configuration. It allows us to easily access the configuration from the application under tests using the `FirestoreEmulatorConfig.fromEnvironment()` factory method.

#### Configure the application

In the application, before the integration tests have started, in the `setUpAll` method we can get the value, that represents the `use-firestore-emulator` parameter to determine whether we are using the local emulator. If so, we can use the `Firestore.instance.settings()` to connect the application to the running emulator using the default port from the `FirestoreEmulatorConfig` instance.

With this, all requests to the `Firestore` database will point to the `Firestore emulator`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrate the process of running the integration tests with the emulator:
