## View models for UI components: pros & cons.
> Give the main pros & cons about using the `view model`.

> Explain and compare 2 main approaches of using the `view model`.

### Single view model

### View model composition

## Widget creation guidelines
> Explain/diagram an algorithm of creating a new `widget`.

Main questions: 
1. Should we create a separate widget for each view? For example Coverage and Stability widgets VS ProjectMetricPercent widget.
2. Describe the approach of applying the view model. This means we should explain exactly where we should use the view model and where we should use the base dart types.
3. Flow diagram for creating a new widget.

## Algorithm of applying theme (and the theme structure ??) (rename)
> Explain/diagram the metrics theme structure.

> Explain the algorithm of applying the metrics theme to the widgets.

> Explain the algorithm of adding a new theme components for new widgets.
