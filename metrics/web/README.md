# Metrics Web Application :tada:

The Flutter web application that displays project metrics on easy to navigate Dashboard.

## Getting Started :beginner:

This application is a part of Metrics project. It is developed using different solutions described in the documents under the `docs` folder. The purpose of this documentation is to collect and structurize knowledge used for developing the Metrics Web Application. Here is the easy to navigate list of these documents: 
1. [Metrics Web Application architecture :walking:](docs/01_metrics_web_application_architecture.md)
2. [Metrics Web presentation layer architecture :running:](docs/02_presentation_layer_architecture.md)
3. [Widget structure organization :bicyclist:](docs/03_widget_structure_organization.md)

## Setup :rocket:

As Metrics Web Application is developed using Flutter for web, the installed Flutter SDK configured for web is required. Use the following steps to get ready for further setup: 
1. [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) Flutter SDK.
2. [Configure](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web) Flutter SDK for web.

After the above steps are complete, use the following commands to ensure everything works properly and as expected: 
```
flutter version 1.15.3
flutter upgrade
flutter config --enable-web
```

That is, your machine is ready to run the Metrics Web Application! :champagne:

## Run :runner:

To run the Metrics Web Application, you can use your IDE runner with Chrome device selected. To run the application from command-line, use the following command:
```
flutter run -d chrome
```
