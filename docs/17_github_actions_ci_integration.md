To be able to track the state of the applications under development, we should create `YAML` configuration files for each project that will be used by the CI Integrations tool to sync the build data with the Metrics Web application. Assume we have an `Awesome Project` and an `awesome_actions.yml` workflow file with `Awesome Project Actions` job used to run tests of the `Awesome Project`. If so, let's create a sample configuration file for this project. The configuration should consist of the following parts: 

- [Source configuration](#Source-configuration)
- [Destination configuration](#Destination-configuration) 

Let's consider this parts separately: 

## Source configuration

The `source` part describes the source of the build data - GitHub Actions in our case. Let's consider a `source` configuration for the `Awesome Project`: 

```yaml
source:
  github_actions:
    workflow_identifier: awesome_actions.yml
    repository_name: awesome_repository
    repository_owner: awesome
    access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    job_name: Awesome Project Actions
    coverage_artifact_name: coverage_report
```

So, the GitHub Actions configuration consists of the following properties: 

| Property name           | Type           | Description  |
| ----------------------- |:--------------:| ----------------------------------|
| workflow_identifier     | Public         | An identifier of the building workflow to export data from. Commonly is a workflow file name. |
| repository_name         | Public         | A name of the repository that contains the specified workflow. |
| repository_owner        | Public         | A username or an organization name that owns the repository. |
| access_token            | Secret         | A GitHub API access token. If you are using the GitHub actions to run the synchronization, you can use the default token from secrets `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, otherwise, you can create your personal access token using this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Your token should have the `repo` scope to be able to load the data from the GitHub Actions API.|
| job_name                | Public         | A name of the job inside of the workflow with the provided `workflow_identifier`. The build data of this job will be exported to the Metrics Web Application.|
| coverage_artifact_name  | Public         | A name of the coverage artifact exported from your building workflow. Notice, that the coverage artifact should be in the [CI Integrations format](https://github.com/platform-platform/monorepo/blob/master/metrics/ci_integrations/docs/01_ci_integration_module_architecture.md#coverage-report-format). You can use the [Coverage Converter](https://github.com/platform-platform/monorepo/releases/tag/coverage-converter-snapshot) tool to convert the report generated by your coverage tool to the CI Integrations readable format. |


## Destination configuration

Since we want to export data to the Metrics Web Application, we should specify the destination `firestore` configuration. Let's consider the example `firestore` configuration: 

```yaml
destination:
  firestore:
    firebase_project_id: project_id
    firebase_user_email: awesome_user@cool.cool
    firebase_user_pass: awesome_password
    firebase_public_api_key: apiKey
    metrics_project_id: awesome_project
```

So, the `firestore` configuration should contain the following keys: 

| Property Name            | Type   | Description  |
| ------------------------ |:------:| -------------|
| firebase_project_id      | Public | A firebase project identifier where to export the data. |
| firebase_user_email      | Secret | A firebase user email used to log in to the Metrics Web Application. |
| firebase_user_pass       | Secret | A firebase user password used to log in to the Metrics Web Application. |
| firebase_public_api_key  | Secret | A public API key that could be created using the Google Cloud Platform in the [API & Services credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=metrics-d9c67) section. This key should have access to the `Identity Toolkit API`. |
| metrics_project_id       | Public | A firestore document identifier of the project to import data to. |

__*Please, NOTE*__ that the `Secret` values must be stored as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). The configuration file can contain this fields as a environment variables. To replace them in the GitHub actions workflow you can use `gettext`  or replace it using the `sed` tool. The example of using the `sed` command provided in the [Metrics Integration Actions](#Metrics-Integration-Actions) section.

Once we've finished creating the configuration file, we should configure the GitHub Actions that will export the build data to the Metrics Web application. 

To export the data, we should configure the following actions: 

- [`Metrics Integration Actions`](#Metrics-Integration-Actions) - the workflow needed to export the data to the Metrics Web application using the CI Integrations component.
- [`Notify about the building project`](#Notify-about-the-building-project) - the job needed to notify the `Metrics Integration Actions` that some project build was started.

Let's consider each action in more detail.

## Metrics Integration Actions

A `Metrics Integration Actions` is a workflow used to export the build data to the Metrics Web application. This workflow triggers on repository dispatch event with `building_project` type. The `building_project` repository dispatch event, in its turn, should contain the information about which project build started as a `client_payload` JSON. Let's assume we have some project named `Awesome Project`. In this case, the `building_project` event should accept the `client_payload` with the `building_awesome_project` boolean field.

Let's consider the sample `Metrics Integration Actions` workflow file: 

```yaml
name: Metrics Integration Actions

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [ building_project ]

jobs:
  awesome_project_sync:
    name: Awesome Project build data sync
    runs-on: macos-latest
    if: github.event.client_payload.building_awesome_project == 'true'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
          ref: ${{ github.ref }}
      - name: Download Ci integrations
        run: |
          curl -o ci_integrations -k https://github.com/platform-platform/monorepo/releases/download/ci_integrations-snapshot/ci_integrations_macos -L
          chmod a+x ci_integrations
      - name: Wait For Awesome Project check finished
        uses: fountainhead/action-wait-for-check@v1.0.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          checkName: Notify about building the Awesome Project
          ref: ${{ github.sha }}
          timeoutSeconds: 3600
      - name: Apply environment variables
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          WEB_APP_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.WEB_APP_USER_EMAIL }}
          WEB_APP_USER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.WEB_APP_USER_PASSWORD }}
          CI_INTEGRATIONS_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CI_INTEGRATIONS_FIREBASE_API_KEY }}
        run: eval "echo \"$(sed 's/"/\\"/g' awesome_config.yml)\"" >> integration.yml
        working-directory: awesome_project/
      - name: Awesome Project build data sync
        run: ./ci_integrations sync --config-file .metrics/integration.yml
```

So, once the `Metrics Integration Actions` workflow receives the `building_project` repository dispatch event, it gets the project that is currently building from the `client_payload` and starts the job that corresponds to the building project to export the building data. The synchronization job, in its turn, checkouts the repository, waits until the project's building job gets finished, downloads the `CI Integrations` tool, and runs the synchronization process.

__*Please, NOTE*__  that since we are using the [Wait For Check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wait-for-check) action that allows us to wait until the job gets finished, we should wait unlit the last workflow job gets finished. Usually, this job is a `Notify about the building project`. It is needed to be sure that the project's building workflow is finished and we can get the building artifacts from this workflow if there any.

## Notify about the building project

The `Notify about the building project` step notifies the `Metrics Integration Actions` about some project's build started. As I've mentioned above, this job should emit a repository dispatch event containing `client_payload` with the data about the current building project. To send the repository dispatch event, we are using the [Repository Dispatch](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repository-dispatch) action.

Also, to reduce the amount of time taken for the `Metrics Integration Actions` workflow, we should run the `Notify about the building project` job after all jobs in the project building workflow. To do so, this job should depend on all jobs from the current workflow, defining the [needs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds) key in the configuration file. Moreover, the `Notify about the building project` job should run even if any of the other jobs canceled/failed, so it should include `if: "always()"` option.

Let's consider the example of the `Notify about the building project` job for `Awesome project` in our repository: 

Assume we have a workflow containing the following jobs: 

- `Run tests` with `run_awesome_tests` identifier.
- `Build and publish` with `build_and_publish_app` identifier.


So, the `Notify about the building project` for this project will look like this: 

```yml
  notify-actions:
    name: Notify about building the Awesome project
    runs-on: macos-latest
    needs: [ run_awesome_tests, build_and_publish_app ]
    if: "always()"
    steps:
      - name: Notify about building the Awesome project
        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}
          repository: platform-platform/monorepo
          event-type: building_project
          client-payload: '{"building_awesome_project": "true"}'
```

As you can see above, the `Notify about building the Awesome project` uses some `ACTIONS_TOKEN` secret. This secret is a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) that is configured to have access to all public and private repositories of the user.
